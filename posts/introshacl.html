The SHapes Constraint Language (SHACL) is a language in which you
define constraints over RDF graphs. You can write things like: "every
person needs to know someone" and the RDF graph can <i>conform</i> to that
constraint or not. Such a SHACL constraint is referred to as a
<i>shape</i>. In practice you often write a set of these shapes which define
your expectations of some RDF graph. This set of shapes is referred to
as a SHACL <i>shapes graph</i>. The name contains "graph" because these
shapes are themselves written as an RDF graph. To distinguish a SHACL
<i>shapes graph</i> from the data it validates (which is of course also RDF)
we refer to the data as the <i>data graph</i>.
</p>

<p>
The above description of SHACL immediatly brings us to its main
function: checking conformance. Given a shapes graph and a data graph,
we want to know if the data graph adheres to all shapes defined in the
shapes graph. This is clearly a useful task in practice as you want to
know if your data is in the right format for you to process.
</p>

<p>
It is useful to consider the rough anatomy of a shape. It consists of
three main components:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the shape name,</li>
<li>the target declaration(s), and</li>
<li>the shape definition.</li>
</ul>
<p>
(I deviate slightly from the specification which defines a shape more
broadly. However, for the purpose of this exposition, I like my
definition better) Consider the example:
</p>
<pre class="example" id="orge216126">
:SocialShape a sh:PropertyShape ;
    sh:path schema:knows ;
    sh:minCount 1 .

:SocialShape sh:targetClass schema:Person .
</pre>
<p>
Here, we have one shape called <code>:SocialShape</code> which states that the
<i>focus nodes</i> in the data graph need to have at least one outgoing
<code>schema:knows</code> edge. Informally, "focus node" just means the node that
is considered to adhere to this shape. The focus nodes here are given
by the target declaration on the last line. The targeting statement
describes all nodes that are of <code>rdf:type schema:Person</code>. So all nodes
in the data graph that are declared to be of type <code>schema:Person</code> will
be considered as focus node for <code>:SocialShape</code>.
</p>

<p>
Conformance captures the spirit of SHACL. However, when your graph
does not conform to your constraints, you want to know where the
problems occur. In this case, conformance is not good enough. We need
some report stating which nodes do not satisfy which shape in the
shapes graph. The task of generating such a report is called
<i>validation</i>.
</p>

<p>
To be continued&#x2026; I initially wrote this post just to give people
some idea of what SHACL is, as the specification is too cryptic to be
useful as a short introduction.

<h1 class="title">Our dog Tofu</h1>
</header><p>
My partner and I have a dog. His name is Tofu and he's somewhere
between an Australian Shepperd and a Border Collie, but mostly we
don't care.
</p>

<p>
Raising a dog requires quite some dedication, especially when the dog
is high energy. I'd describe Tofu as having medium-high energy, meaning
that he has high energy but it could be somewhat higher. (I used to
think he was inexhaustible, but now I'm used to it. After having a dog
for a while, you meet other dog owners and notice the
differences. I've met truly high energy dogs and I thank the old man
in the sky that they are not mine.)
</p>

<p>
Anyway, I just wanted to link to some good resources about dog
training and behaviour. The web is wild, and finding good information
is difficult. I learned a lot from these books:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.worldcat.org/nl/title/54700752">The other end of the leash</a> by <a href="https://www.patriciamcconnell.com/learning-center/">Patricia McConnell</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.worldcat.org/nl/title/63519566">Calming Signals</a> by <a href="http://en.turid-rugaas.no/">Turid Rugaas</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
I also got some experience with dog training by going to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obedience_trial">obedience</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_agility">agility</a> classes. (Make no mistake, dog training schools are for dog
<i>owners</i>, not the dogs.)
</p>

<p>
There are many dog training schools you can go to where I live and
I've been to two. The first one was old-school and used so-called
"balanced" training techniques, meaning they use both reward and
punishment in training. However, in practice, it was often unbalanced
unnecessary punishment. We left them. Now, we're going to a school
which primarily uses reward-based training techniques. It's going
great.

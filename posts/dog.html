<h1 class="title">Tofu &#x2014; My High Energy Dog</h1>
</header><p>
Since June of 2021, we have a dog. His name is Tofu and he is about 10
months old. He's mostly an Australian Shepperd and this breed is known
to be high-energy and very intelligent. Most of the time, he is
delightful but recently we noticed his energy levels were spiking
twice every day. Once at noon, and once in the evening. Appearently,
we conditioned him to regulate his energy this way. This does not
immediatly sound like a problem, but these energy spikes are too much
to handle and it makes taking him anywhere (that is not the dog park)
a nightmare.
</p>

<p>
We need to teach him to distribute his energy more evenly throughout
the day.

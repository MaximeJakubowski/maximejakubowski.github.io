Note: This post is an adaptation of <a href="phd.html">Section 1.2 of my PhD thesis</a>, and
serves as a general intro to <a href="https://lmcs.episciences.org/13143/pdf">our paper on the subject</a>. The purpose of
publishing it as a standalone blogpost is to further disseminate my
writings. It is part of a short series of posts representing the
Introduction of my thesis:

Given the definition of SHACL as a constraint language, users are
often interested in what you can actually <i>do</i> with it; what shapes can
you actually write? When a language is defined, many criteria are
postulated on what the language should be able to describe. Often,
these are then <i>directly</i> included in the language. A simple example is
the <i>class constraint component</i> in SHACL. This allows for writing
shapes stating that the focus node must be of a certain RDF class (or
subclass thereof). It is easy to observe this feature is technically
redundant: if we would remove this constraint component from SHACL,
the expressive power would remain the same, because we can already
express it using other constraint components. For example, given an
IRI <code>:c</code> every shape of the form:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-ttl">[ <span style="color: #531ab6;">a</span> <span style="color: #005f5f;">sh:</span><span style="color: #0000b0;">NodeShape</span> <span style="color: #531ab6;">;</span>
  <span style="color: #005f5f;">sh:</span><span style="color: #0000b0;">class</span> <span style="color: #005f5f;">:</span><span style="color: #0000b0;">c</span>
]
</pre>
</div>

<p>
can be written as the shape:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-ttl">[ <span style="color: #531ab6;">a</span> <span style="color: #005f5f;">sh:</span><span style="color: #0000b0;">PropertyShape</span> <span style="color: #531ab6;">;</span>
  <span style="color: #005f5f;">sh:</span><span style="color: #0000b0;">path</span> ( [ <span style="color: #005f5f;">sh:</span><span style="color: #0000b0;">zeroOrMorePath</span> <span style="color: #005f5f;">rdfs:</span><span style="color: #0000b0;">subClassOf</span> ] <span style="color: #005f5f;">rdf:</span><span style="color: #0000b0;">type</span> ) <span style="color: #531ab6;">;</span>
  <span style="color: #005f5f;">sh:</span><span style="color: #0000b0;">hasValue</span> <span style="color: #005f5f;">:</span><span style="color: #0000b0;">c</span>
]
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Clearly, constraints about classes are useful, so it is included in
the language. However, our example shows that the complex path
expressions are more fundamental to SHACL. We have these, so we can
already do class constraints.
</p>

<p>
This discussion of the class constraint component is quite clear cut;
it is easy to see that it is expressible by other features. Now, a
natural question arises: does this also happen for other constraint
components? Can we, for example, express the <i>equals constraint
component</i> using other SHACL features? In this case it is not clear
whether this is possible, but how can you be certain that it is <i>not</i>
expressible? These are the expressiveness questions we investigate in
<a href="https://lmcs.episciences.org/13143/pdf">our paper</a> (and to actually answer the question, no, you cannot
express equality with the other features).
</p>

<p>
To add to the relevance of this kind of investigation, the SHACL
community is interested in <i>extending</i> SHACL with other constraint
components called the <a href="https://datashapes.org/constraints.html">DASH Constraint Components</a>. It turns out that
most of these constraint components are not easily (or at all)
expressible with SHACL as it is, but if we extend SHACL with a more
powerful version of the equality constraint component, <a href="datashapes.html">the DASH
extensions become expressible</a>! As a concrete example, DASH proposes a
constraint <code>dash:nonRecursive</code> on property shapes that states
that there must not be a path (from <code>sh:path</code>) from the focus
node, to the focus node. In other words, there may not be a self-loop
(following the path) in the data graph for the focus node. This can be
expressed with the shape:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-ttl"><span style="color: #005f5f;">:</span><span style="color: #0000b0;">noLoop</span> <span style="color: #531ab6;">a</span> <span style="color: #005f5f;">sh:</span><span style="color: #0000b0;">NodeShape</span>
  <span style="color: #005f5f;">sh:</span><span style="color: #0000b0;">not</span> [ <span style="color: #531ab6;">a</span> <span style="color: #005f5f;">sh:</span><span style="color: #0000b0;">PropertyShape</span> <span style="color: #531ab6;">;</span>
           <span style="color: #005f5f;">sh:</span><span style="color: #0000b0;">path</span> <span style="color: #721045;">&lt;path&gt;</span> <span style="color: #531ab6;">;</span>
           <span style="color: #005f5f;">sh:</span><span style="color: #0000b0;">equals</span> [ <span style="color: #005f5f;">sh:</span><span style="color: #0000b0;">zeroOrOnePath</span> <span style="color: #721045;">&lt;path&gt;</span> ]
         ] <span style="color: #531ab6;">.</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
However, this shape is technically not a correct SHACL shape because
the <code>sh:equals</code> keyword may only have IRIs as their value, not
blank nodes (and thus not paths). Nevertheless, the meaning is clear.
</p>

<p>
The point here is not to say that DASH is superfluous, rather, it is
simply to give insight in what is fundamentally happening when you add
features to SHACL. It turns out that adding full-path support to the
equality feature lets us also express some other DASH constraints,
indicating that adding full equality to SHACL is useful. Furthermore,
it may give insights to developers implementing SHACL validators: not
every added feature requires implementing new algorithms to support
that feature.

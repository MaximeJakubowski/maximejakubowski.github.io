        <h1>Welcome</h1>>
        Welcome to my bare-bones homepage. I'm Maxime Jakubowski, student Msc. Artificial Intelligence with a computer science background. The goal of this webpage is 
        to have a place to share some of the stuff I do. 

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        Right now, I sadly don't have much to show off on this page. Only one little project I'm currently working on:
    
        <ul>
            <li><a href='/camino.html'>Camino statistics</a></li>
        </ul>

	    <h1>2D Boids</h1>
	    <p>This page was made to show the concept of emergent intelligent behaviour. It shows my implementation of the boids system for flocking behaviour. The goal of this program is to have a primitive flocking behaviour. Groups of agents (called boids) move together in a seemingly natural way. This behaviour is realized by implementing three simple rules outlined below.</p>
	    <dl>
		<dt>Alignment</dt>
		<dd>Move in the same direction as the others.</dd>
		<dt>Cohesion</dt>
		<dd>Move to the center of the flock of other boids.</dd>
		<dt>Separation</dt>
		<dd>Avoid running into other boids.</dd>
	    </dl>

	    <h2>Implementation</h2>
	    <p>The implementation of this system is done in a classical computer-graphics way. The actual drawing is done with the Processing for Javascript library <a href="https://p5js.org">p5js</a>. The implementation consists out of vector calculations. Every boid has a position and velocity vector. </p>
	    <p>The alignment rule states that my velocity vector should be moved closer to the average vector of my neighbours. My neighbours beeing the boids which are in my area. In my implementation this is just the boids within some specified range. This could alternatively be defined as in the field of view of the boid.</p>
	    <p>The cohesion rule in terms of vectors is just the act of moving the velocity vector to point to the average center of the neighbours of the boid. </p>
	    <p>The separation rule states that that my velocity vector should move away if some other boid is close to it. </p>
	    <p>My implementation can be found <a href="boidsv2.js">here</a>.</p>
